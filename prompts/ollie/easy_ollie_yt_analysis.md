A lot of what we will focus on today is how to go from the hippy jump where your tail is just bouncing on the ground into a really nice ollie where we get the board to flatten out at the top.

It's okay if the toe of your shoe touches or is on the rail, but please don't hang your toes off, and it's even more important for your back foot. Our front foot placement will be just underneath the front bolts, or you can even touch the front bolts if you'd like, but as your feet get wider, it gets harder and harder to pop. As your feet get more narrow, the balance will become more unstable at the bottom of your squat, so it'll be harder to get out of the bottom to initiate that jump. So that's the game we're playing. Too narrow, you're going to lose your balance. Too wide, it's going to be hard to pop. So you'll have to find the sweet spot for yourself."

    "transcription": "Something that every skill level should practice, when you're initiating the hippy jump, make sure that you're holding the board flat in a straight line, as you're pushing against the board to get the power to jump. This means you're not leaning off of the heel side, or you're not jumping off of the toe side to get these jumps rolling. And at first, you're just going to have to look at the board to know. I recommend that you take the time to set your wheels up right along a crack. So then, when you're skating, you can see if you're going in a straight line, or you can see if you're swerving unnecessarily. And as you initiate the jump, you'll get really good feedback on which direction you're more likely to turn. I promise that you're turning more than you think. So if you set up your wheels on the crack, and you go to initiate your jump, and you're swerving all over this thing, that is a problem that's worth solving. Get your foot position a little bit better, find your squat into the balls of your feet, really focus your energy on holding the board flat. That's how we get our power up in the air. If you're squatting and tipping forward or backwards, you're going to lose power in your jump. You're killing the height of your ollie before it even starts. A very underrated skill that you can work on right now on your hippy jumps is controlling your foot position on landing. Okay? It's easy to focus to get your fundamentals right, to be disciplined and set your feet up right for the takeoff, but once you jump, fear kicks in and a lot of people lose connection with their feet. So I want you to land from your hippy jumps with your back foot on the tail, and your front foot underneath the front bolts. This will feel like a very tight foot position, it'll feel a little bit different than you're used to, and it's exactly the same as the takeoff position, right? Set up, jump, and land. Same position."

Please go into your brain, delete that, and get used to hinging your upper body so your chest can point more towards the ground when you're in your squat. And then when you jump, don't just pull your upper body up and then try and jump. There's a bunch of reasons, but the main reason we don't want to do that is because we lose our vision right away.

I spend most of my energy keeping my upper body still and just pushing into the legs. Okay? We would call this something akin to a partial squat, straight leg jump.

It's not shifting backwards or forwards. Dude, I nailed it. I nailed it. We lift the nose in the air by creating space between our front foot and the ground. Okay? If my front foot is on the board and my back foot is on the tail, I cannot take my front foot off the board. If I step forward or backwards, this front foot will not come off the board unless I put my tail on the ground, then I can pick it up. Okay? This isn't from planting extra weight in my back foot. If I just stomp on my tail, I would literally break my tail before my nose comes in the air. All I have to do is pick this one up. Okay? So when you're doing a hippy jump, and you want to lift the nose, you just have to learn how to time your extension, your little jump, with creating a little bit of space on your front foot. Not by going like this, just by jumping over your front leg, lifting it in the air a little bit. You can start this by jumping and only taking your back foot off. Your front foot can stay on the board, and your nose will lift in the air, and your feet can stay at the same level. Then you can just jump a little higher. Leave that board behind.

This little bit of tension that you feel when you straighten that leg and you're standing on the back truck, that is where you're going to hippy jump from. So, as you're trying to figure out how to jump and lift the nose, go back and forth. Do a hippy jump and lift the nose, then plant the tail on the ground, push down a couple of times, try not to fall forward or backwards, then go back to it, hippy jump and lift the nose. You should be able to find that small hippy jump lifting the nose with some time if you just work on those two skills back and forth. Does this remind you of your practice? Always chasing something and not getting any closer? Make sure you go to our website and check out our programs so you can start getting better faster. Okay, now that we're onto hippy jump, lift the nose. Let's talk about how you even lift the nose. To explain this properly, I first want you to understand how my balance is shifting backwards and forwards to lift and set down the nose. Okay? It's very simple. It's not shifting backwards or forwards. Dude, I nailed it. I nailed it. We lift the nose in the air by creating space between our front foot and the ground. Okay? If my front foot is on the board and my back foot is on the tail, I cannot take my front foot off the board. If I step forward or backwards, this front foot will not come off the board unless I put my tail on the ground, then I can pick it up. Okay? This isn't from planting extra weight in my back foot. If I just stomp on my tail, I would literally break my tail before my nose comes in the air. All I have to do is pick this one up. Okay? So when you're doing a hippy jump, and you want to lift the nose, you just have to learn how to time your extension, your little jump, with creating a little bit of space on your front foot. Not by going like this, just by jumping over your front leg, lifting it in the air a little bit. You can start this by jumping and only taking your back foot off. Your front foot can stay on the board, and your nose will lift in the air, and your feet can stay at the same level. Then you can just jump a little higher. Leave that board behind. It will take some touch, okay? This is the this is the interesting part about finding the tension for your pops. There's a little bit of push and pull on your front foot. It's not all pull. You're not only picking it up. You're extending off of the board and you're feathering the nose in the air by feeling tension on your front foot and jumping, okay? A way we can feel that is by starting on your tail, keeping your balance there, and pushing your front foot down as hard as you can without falling over it, and then going back on your tail. This is going to force you to stand up tall and to stay over the back trucks so you're not hitting your front foot on the ground. If you were to do this off the board, right, it looks like this.

So when you're doing a hippy jump, and you want to lift the nose, you just have to learn how to time your extension, your little jump, with creating a little bit of space on your front foot. Not by going like this, just by jumping over your front leg, lifting it in the air a little bit. You can start this by jumping and only taking your back foot off. Your front foot can stay on the board, and your nose will lift in the air, and your feet can stay at the same level. Then you can just jump a little higher. Leave that board behind. It will take some touch, okay? This is the this is the interesting part about finding the tension for your pops. There's a little bit of push and pull on your front foot. It's not all pull. You're not only picking it up. You're extending off of the board and you're feathering the nose in the air by feeling tension on your front foot and jumping, okay? A way we can feel that is by starting on your tail, keeping your balance there, and pushing your front foot down as hard as you can without falling over it, and then going back on your tail. This is going to force you to stand up tall and to stay over the back trucks so you're not hitting your front foot on the ground. If you were to do this off the board, right, it looks like this. Okay? If I squat down too much, I'm just going to be stomping on the ground. Right? You see how these motions are connected. This little bit of tension that you feel when you straighten that leg and you're standing on the back truck, that is where you're going to hippy jump from. So, as you're trying to figure out how to jump and lift the nose, go back and forth. Do a hippy jump and lift the nose, then plant the tail on the ground, push down a couple of times, try not to fall forward or backwards, then go back to it, hippy jump and lift the nose. You should be able to find that small hippy jump lifting the nose with some time if you just work on those two skills back and forth. Does this remind you of your practice? Always chasing something and not getting any closer? Make sure you go to our website and check out our programs so you can start getting better faster. When you do an ollie, your back foot never touches the ground, and you have to be able to control where you're jumping from. Attempting to jump with your wheels only a millimeter off of the ground is a great way to practice sending the tail at the ground. And the last thing I want you to practice is trying to bounce your tail two or three times in one jump. You can get creative in the direction you're sending the tail. So if you push the board forward, as you pop, you're going to scrape the ground and be able to bounce the tail a couple of times in one jump. These are the stepping stones to an ollie. You can also try and send the board the other way. You can send the board backwards as you're doing hippy jumps and hitting the tail. This will give you a great sense of the job your back foot has in the pop and how to adjust that. And the job your front foot and your front leg has when it comes to controlling where that nose is going as you go into the air. If you ignore the board, it's going up into the air, going back under the knee, and then I can set it down in the middle of the board. So it's a very small movement forward with that front foot at the top. And it's paired with that upward motion to flatten it out. And it's facilitated by getting the board going up and backwards into both your feet at the top. Now that you got the spiel on everything that we're trying to accomplish, I'm going to give you a couple of drills you can practice it yourself. Drill one is just a dynamic ollie. While you're rolling forward and focus on popping and sending your back foot backwards a little bit as you pop and bring that nose up into you as hard as you can. Don't think about trying to jump as high as you can. Don't think about trying to get the board up into the air as high as you can. I want you to find maximum pressure from your nose up against your front foot. If you're finding a lot of pressure, and you can feel the nose in the air right here, you're in good shape. Most people try and push down and forward. It makes it really hard to get the tail into the air. So that means we're bringing the nose this way towards us and not just up into the air. That's a big perspective shift. And I I think it's going to be really helpful. You can also practice it going fakie. The biggest problem that people have with fakie ollies is they leave the board behind. But if you think about exactly what we're talking about, all you got to do is send that board with your back foot a little bit towards where you're going. It'll stay right under you. So, a drill to focus on your front foot, hip circles. I want you to pick your front foot up to the inside and just bring your front foot up and around and then set it down in the exact same spot. And then try this same motion when you're doing an ollie. Okay, it's going to start in a comfortable spot, go up to the inside, up and over, and then we'll set it down. You're going to be searching a lot for your front foot path while you're practicing this. That's okay. You've never paid attention to your foot path ever before. All you've tried to do is feel the grip tape and feel a sliding motion, and maybe try to time a jump and not understand what's going on. So if it's confusing, if it's hard to connect your brain to your front foot and to change your foot path, that's all right. Give it time. Take your ollies slow, but spend the time working on it because that's the only way you'll ever find the foot path that you need. All right. That's pretty good. Now that you can put all those skills together, go through the ollie complex over and over and find your ollies. Okay, good luck. I'm counting on you guys. So that was the easiest way to ollie. But it turns out, ollies are still pretty hard. So if you're struggling, check out our website, SkateIQ.com. We have a bunch of programs. One of them is the Art of Popping. So if you want to take the guesswork out of your practice, you know exactly which drill to practice, and for how long, and what to do next. We have all that mapped out for you. Thanks for watching. See you in the next one."
