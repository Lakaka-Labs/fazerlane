Oh, great. Right foot forward. Then Tony Hawk will have you attempt to do a kick turn. For this, Tony Hawk will push you into the ramp as if you are a baby, and you will attempt to maneuver your body and the board so that you might turn and keep on skating. You won't be able to do it, even though it seems like it should be very simple and you will fall. Eventually you'll do it halfway, and you'll decide that that's good enough. Tony will be disappointed."

    "transcription": "The the concept, the physics behind ollie is basically snapping the board using your back foot so that you get it almost vertically in the air. You know, not quite, but but close. And then your front foot slides forward right as it snaps and that levels it out. And that brings it up to both feet. You'll watch Tony Hawk do it, and it will hit you now more than ever that what you've essentially signed up for is the opportunity to embarrass yourself in front of Tony Hawk and later the entire internet. And that motion seems super easy, it's real subtle, but it's all in the timing. Okay."

The Ollie is a fundamental maneuver and is the gateway for just about every flip trick in skateboarding. Whether you're just starting to learn or want to improve your Ollies, this guide will give you a clear understanding of the mechanics and the technique. I'd recommend waiting to try to learn Ollies until you're very comfortable with riding your board, because having that familiarity will help you learn Ollies much quicker. With that said, let's talk about the mechanics of the Ollie. Conceptually, the Ollie is very simple, but mastering the technique can be tricky at first because it's all about timing and independently coordinated foot motions. But once you develop the muscle memory, it'll become automatic."

    "transcription": "First, let's talk about the foot placement. Throughout the Ollie, keep your feet perpendicular and your shoulders parallel with the board. Place the ball of the back of your foot on the tip of the tail, and your front foot somewhere in the middle. The placement of your front foot isn't too critical, but you don't want it too close to the nose because you won't have any room to slide up the grip, and you also don't want it too far back because it's harder to balance. So, anywhere in this region should work fine. Also, don't hang your front foot too far off either side of the board. I generally like to have the tips of my toes right at the edge of the deck."

    "title": "Mastering the Jump and Tail Pop",
    "summary": "This segment meticulously breaks down the initial 'jump' and 'pop' actions essential for the Ollie. It clarifies that the entire maneuver begins with a jump, and the pop and slide occur within this jump. The instructor demonstrates how to utilize the balls of your feet for maximum spring and emphasizes using calf muscles and ankle power for a powerful, straight-down pop while avoiding common mistakes that can cause the board to rotate or backflip.",

    "transcription": "Now, let's talk about the individual foot motions a little more in depth. Mastering the timing and coordination of the feet is the biggest hurdle in learning Ollies. So, I'm going to break down the motions for each foot. The entire maneuver is initiated with the jump, and the pop and slide all occur within the jump. Practice a few jumps where you hoist your feet up to get the feeling of what kind of jump you'll need to do. The jump is going to determine the height of the Ollie, and the higher you can pull up your feet, the higher the potential Ollie. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet, because nobody jumps off a flat foot. When people jump, they spring up off the balls of their feet. This will allow you to get a much better jump and pop. When you're bending your knees for the jump, don't lean forward too far, like you're touching your toes, and you don't need to crouch all the way down because it's not going to help you get any higher. Just a nice 45 to 90° crouch will be fine. The pop is the most important part of the Ollie because without the pop, the board isn't coming off the ground. The back foot's only job is to pop down the tail and then immediately get out of the way to allow the board to bounce upward. The power for the pop will come from your calf muscles and your ankle. Many beginners try to pop the tail with a flat foot, using their whole leg and knee for the pop, but you won't get a good jump or any kind of power that way. Just practice this motion for a little bit. The harder you pop, the more the board will bounce up and stick to your feet, which will give you more control. The pop should be straight down. Don't angle the pop to either side because it'll cause the board to rotate, and we're trying Ollies, not shuvits."

    "title": "Executing the Front Foot Slide and Leveling",
    "summary": "This segment focuses on the critical role of the front foot in the Ollie. It explains how the front foot lifts and slides up the board towards the nose, tilting slightly inward to catch the griptape, and then pushes forward to level out the board. This leveling action is essential for achieving height and preventing the common 'rocket' or vertical board stance, demonstrating a key circular motion for optimal execution.",
    "learning_objectives": ["Perform the upward sliding motion with the front foot to guide the board", "Tilt the front ankle slightly inward to catch the griptape effectively", "Push the nose forward with the front foot to level out the board", "Avoid the 'rocket' effect by correctly leveling the board mid-air"],
    "visual_elements": ["Slow-motion demonstrations of the front foot sliding and leveling", "Close-ups of the front foot tilting and pushing", "Visual diagram of the front foot's circular motion", "Examples of a 'rocketed' board vs. a leveled board"],
    "transcription": "The front foot's job is to lift and slide upwards towards the nose and to push the nose forward in order to level out the back end. As you're lifting and sliding, tilt your front ankle slightly inwards so the side of your shoe catches the grip tape. The side of the shoe provides better traction on the grip tape and it will make it easier to lift up and control. Part two of the front foot motion is to push forward and level out the board. This is key for actually getting some height in the Ollie. If you don't level out the board, it ends up staying vertical or rocket, and it's hard to make it over things because the tail is still drooping down. It might help to think of the action of the front foot as almost a circular motion. It lifts up, pushes forward, then comes back down under you."

    "title": "Full Ollie Sequence: Timing, Coordination, and Landing",
    "summary": "This section synthesizes all the individual Ollie mechanics—the jump, pop, and slide—into a single, coordinated sequence, emphasizing precise timing for successful execution. It covers the crucial moments for each foot's action: the back foot's pop just before leaving the deck and the front foot's slide and push for leveling. The segment concludes with instructions on how to commit to a balanced landing, recommending landing with both feet simultaneously over the hardware bolts.",
    "learning_objectives": ["Synchronize the jump, tail pop, and front foot slide into one fluid motion", "Execute the back foot pop precisely as feet leave the deck", "Coordinate the front foot's push to level the board at the jump's peak", "Commit to the landing by bringing both feet down simultaneously over the hardware"],
    "visual_elements": ["Full slow-motion Ollie demonstrating synchronized foot movements", "Visual arrows indicating direction of push and lift for both feet", "Close-up of landing posture on the board"],
    "transcription": "Okay, let's recap the sequence of motions and put them all together. With your feet in place, weight on the balls of your feet and evenly distributed between each foot, initiate the Ollie with an upwards jump. Just before your feet leave the deck, that's when the back foot does the popping motion, and at the same time, the front foot starts the upwards slide, lifting and guiding the board. Immediately after you've popped the tail with your ankle, suck your back foot up and get it out of the way. As your back foot is moving up, your front foot is starting to push the nose forward in order to level out the back end. The forward push should be around the peak of your jump. At the point where the board is leveled out, the only thing left is to commit to the landing. Both feet should come down at the same time, and try to land over the hardware bolts just to start getting in the habit of doing that."

    "title": "Practice Strategies and Building Muscle Memory",
    "summary": "This segment provides crucial practice strategies to help consolidate the Ollie technique. It encourages off-board drills to build muscle memory for individual foot motions, suggests practicing on softer surfaces like grass for confidence without fear of falling, and recommends holding onto a stable object for extended airtime to practice coordination. The segment also highlights the benefits of recording and visualizing attempts for self-correction and mental preparation.",
    "learning_objectives": ["Perform off-board drills to enhance individual foot coordination and timing", "Practice Ollies on grass or carpet to build confidence without slippage", "Utilize stable objects (e.g., bike rack) to practice extended airtime and movements", "Employ visualization techniques to mentally rehearse successful Ollies", "Record and analyze practice attempts to identify and correct mistakes"],

    "transcription": "You don't have to stomp it down, just come down naturally as you would with a jump without the board. During the Ollie, your center of gravity will need to shift to the middle of the board so you can land balanced. All of this takes place within half a second, and I know it seems like a lot to do all at once, but as you start to piece it together, it'll feel like one fluid motion. Here's a couple of pointers to help you learn it faster. You can practice doing the motions for each foot individually, or you can practice the whole motion by jumping on the ground and really focusing on the form. Take off from your popping foot and concentrate on pulling it upwards towards your chest as soon as you leave the ground. With your sliding foot, concentrate on the circular leveling out motion. Exaggerate that front foot leveling out. If it feels like you're doing a ninja kick in mid-air, then you're doing it right. Look at the motion side by side. Even if we take away the board, the motion looks exactly the same. So, even though you might feel a little silly jumping like this, it will help train your muscle memory for the Ollie. If you're scared to try an Ollie on concrete, you can start by practicing on some carpet or some dry grass so you don't slip out. The pop won't be as solid as concrete, but at least you can start building up your confidence and get a little more comfortable trying the motion. Another thing you can try is holding on to something. Find a bike rack or a short fence and hold yourself up when trying the Ollie. It'll give you a little extra air time so you can start piecing together the different movements without the risk of falling. In general, when you're trying tricks, you need to visualize yourself successfully doing it from your own point of view. Visualization is when you mentally rehearse the outcome that you want to unfold and it can give you the confidence you need to do the trick. It can also help if you record your attempts to study the footage to see what you're doing wrong."

    "transcription": "Start practicing Ollies while moving as soon as you're comfortable. Start rolling super slow and get used to landing and continuing rolling. When they start to feel consistent, try Olling over something, like a crack in the sidewalk, a stick, a 2x4 or even another skateboard. After lots of practice, your Ollies will get higher and will feel automatic. You won't have to think about the individual motions because the muscle memory takes over and you'll only have to concentrate on the thing you're Olling over. As you start gaining more control over the board, try adding a little style by poking out your front foot to bone the Ollie or try some variations like shifties or Ollie norths. After you've learned the Ollie, other tricks like kickflips and heel flips will come much faster because you've already done most of the hard work of training your legs to jump, pop, crouch, and land with the proper timing. So, it's important to have a consistent Ollie if you want to continue to progress your skating. One last thing is to not get discouraged. Nobody said that skateboarding was easy. The learning curve is very steep and it won't come in a day. But with determination, you will improve and achieve your goals. And that feeling of accomplishment is what makes all of the hard work worth it."
